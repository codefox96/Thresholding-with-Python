# Thresholding-with-Python
Classification of outputs using basic Machine Learning.
In this program, I defined the input/ output specifications for an 'Or' logic gate (Consisting of 4 unique inputs and their corresponding outputs) and created a very basic two input model with a Sigmoid activation that is then trained. Once the training is complete(after 200 epochs), threshold lines are placed on a graph of the visual representation of the results of each input. This shows that the model can properly differentiate between the inputs that yeild similar results. Lastly, the program shows the graph of the training loss and accuracy after each epoch.
